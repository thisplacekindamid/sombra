		<h2>Sombra weapons and abilities</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Sombra has a submachine gun which she uses as her primary weapon. Her gun is most affective at a close distance.</li>
			<li>Sombra's stealth allows her to be invisble to enemies, but if you approach an enemy within a 4 meter raduis you will be detected. Stealth also gives 60% movement speed when invisble.</li>
			<li>Sombra's translocator allows her to teleport back to safety. You can cancel a translocator by pressing f.</li>
			<li>Sombra's hack allows her to cancel enemies abilities for a temporary time. Her hack lasts 8 seconds and during that time her gun increases damage against the hacked target</li>
			<li>EMP is an incredible ultimate, it hacks all targets and removes 40% of their health.</li>

		</ol>

		<!-- Matchups -->
		<h2>Easy matchups for Sombra</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Tracer: Tracer relies on her abilities which makes her vulnerable to sombra after a hack or emp blast.</li>
			<li>Wrecking ball: same as Tracer Wrecking ball is extremly reliant on his mobility which comes from his abilities.</li>
			<li>Bastion: When he is not in his turret form, Bastion can easily be solo killed by using a hack and spraying at him from a close distance.</li>

		</ol>
		<!-- Hard counters -->
		<h2>Sombra's counters</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Symmetra: her eyes can obliterate your chances of finding a kill against an enemey.</li>
			<li>Reaper: Sombra relies on her submachine gun which can only be used close ranged, exactly where reaper specilizes in.</li>
			<li>Zarya: once her weapon is charged she can wipe out your hp immdiately.</li>
